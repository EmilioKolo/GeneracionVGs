# GeneracionVGs
 Generates all of the possible genetic variants for an exon/protein sequence

Created on June 2020, first uploaded to GitHub on February 2024


Runs from main.py
The code is commented in Spanish
The function needs an amino acid sequence and a set of exon sequences that code for those amino acids. From them, it generates all of the possible missense variants given a single change in one nucleotide. Most of the functionality has been hardcoded.
